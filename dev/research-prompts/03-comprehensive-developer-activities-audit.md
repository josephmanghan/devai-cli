# Research Prompt: Comprehensive Developer Activities Audit

**Created:** 2025-11-12
**Purpose:** Complete, unconstrained inventory of what developers actually do in their day-to-day work
**Target:** Gemini (or similar advanced LLM for research)
**Approach:** Open-ended discovery - no preconceived categories or assumptions

---

I need comprehensive research on what software developers actually do throughout their workday. I want to understand the full scope of developer activities, workflows, and responsibilities without any preconceived limitations or categorizations.

**Context:**

- I'm exploring productivity-focused tools for developers
- I want to avoid imposing my current understanding on the research
- I need to discover activities and workflows I might not be aware of
- The goal is to identify opportunities where AI assistance could provide value

**Please provide a comprehensive audit covering:**

### Daily Activity Inventory

- What are all the activities developers engage in during a typical workday?
- What activities happen outside of "core coding time" that are still essential?
- What are the recurring tasks, workflows, and responsibilities?
- What activities are visible vs. invisible to teams and organizations?
- What work falls between the cracks or doesn't fit neatly into existing tools?

### Work Patterns and Contexts

- How do developers' activities vary based on their role, seniority, or team structure?
- What patterns emerge across different types of development work (frontend, backend, full-stack, DevOps, etc.)?
- How do activities differ based on company size, industry, or development methodology?
- What are the seasonal or project-phase variations in developer work?
- How do personal workflows differ from team or organizational workflows?

### Tools and Environments

- What tools, platforms, and environments do developers interact with daily?
- How do developers move between different tools and contexts?
- What are the integration points and friction areas between tools?
- What activities span multiple tools or require switching contexts?
- What emerging tools or platforms are changing how developers work?

### Communication and Collaboration

- How do developers communicate and collaborate with different stakeholders?
- What are the patterns and overhead of team coordination?
- How do developers handle asynchronous vs. synchronous communication?
- What documentation and knowledge-sharing activities are essential?
- How do developers manage relationships with product managers, designers, QA, etc.?

### Planning and Organization

- What planning and organization activities consume developer time?
- How do developers manage task switching and context switching?
- What are the patterns around estimation, scheduling, and time management?
- How do developers track progress and report status?
- What activities involve prioritization and decision-making?

### Learning and Knowledge Work

- What learning and skill-development activities are part of developer work?
- How do developers stay current with technologies and best practices?
- What research and investigation activities are required?
- How do developers build and maintain domain knowledge?
- What knowledge transfer and mentoring activities occur?

### Problem-Solving and Debugging

- What are the patterns around identifying, diagnosing, and solving problems?
- How do developers handle technical debt and maintenance tasks?
- What are the workflows around testing, quality assurance, and code review?
- How do developers investigate and fix issues or bugs?
- What activities involve troubleshooting system or environment problems?

### Administrative and Meta-Work

- What administrative activities are essential but often overlooked?
- How do developers handle compliance, security, or regulatory requirements?
- What meta-activities around process improvement or team optimization occur?
- How do developers manage career growth, performance reviews, or goal setting?
- What activities involve resource management or infrastructure planning?

### Hidden and Invisible Work

- What essential developer work is often invisible to organizations?
- What activities happen outside of standard project management tools?
- How do developers handle the "glue work" that keeps teams functioning?
- What emotional labor or relationship management is part of developer work?
- What activities are essential but don't appear in time tracking or sprint planning?

**Research Guidelines:**

1. **Be comprehensive** - Include everything from obvious coding tasks to subtle coordination work
2. **Challenge assumptions** - Include activities that might not fit traditional "developer" stereotypes
3. **Think across contexts** - Consider different types of developers, organizations, and work environments
4. **Include emerging patterns** - Cover new activities that have become important recently
5. **Identify pain points** - Highlight areas where developers struggle or face friction
6. **Consider temporal aspects** - How activities vary throughout the day, week, or project lifecycle

**Please provide:**

- Detailed activity descriptions with examples
- Frequency and time investment estimates where relevant
- Connection points between activities
- Identification of high-pain or high-value areas
- Any patterns or insights that emerge from the comprehensive view
- Areas where current tools or processes fall short

The goal is to build a complete picture of developer work that can inform identification of opportunities for productivity improvements and AI assistance.

**Expected Output Format:**

- Comprehensive activity inventory
- Pattern analysis and insights
- Pain point identification
- Contextual variations and considerations
- Opportunities for intervention or improvement
