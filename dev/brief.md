# Joe's Ollama CLI Application Project Brief

## Project Goal

Build a working CLI application that wraps an Ollama SLM model to create a useful dev enablement/assistive utility that can be completed end-to-end and shared on GitHub.

## Personal Requirements & Constraints

### Technical Profile

- **Background**: Angular frontend developer
- **Node.js**: Comfortable with beginner Node.js concepts
- **CLI Experience**: Built basic CLI tools before, quick learner
- **Code Approach**: Comfortable using agents to write code as long as he understands requirements

### Success Criteria

- **Deliverable**: Working application that can be completed end-to-end
- **Scope**: Complete full start-to-finish development lifecycle
- **Sharing**: GitHub-ready project (CV-worthy, though may be basic)
- **Simplicity**: Prioritize achievable MVP over feature-complete

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Deliverability**: Must be achievable as a complete, working project
- **Simplicity**: Prioritize straightforward implementation over complex features
- **Technical Preference**: CLI approach suggested due to Ollama's CLI nature, but web UI not excluded if simpler
- **Learning Focus**: Complete understanding of how each module works
- **GitHub Ready**: Project should be shareable and demonstrate full development process

### Technical Context

- **Platform**: Ollama with local SLM models
- **Current Preference**: `llama3.2` (1B) as "Goldilocks" choice for standard hardware
- **Target Environment**: Standard developer laptops (8GB-16GB)
- **Skills**: Angular frontend developer, comfortable with Node.js concepts

### Available Research Context

The project has extensive [background research](dev/research) already completed:

- ✅ Ollama technical foundation and API capabilities
- ✅ SLM capabilities and constraints analysis
- ✅ Developer activity audit research
- ✅ Application idea exploration (Screenshot Autopilot, Task Manager, etc.)
- ✅ CLI patterns and developer workflow analysis

### Key Questions to Resolve in Next Session

1. Which application idea best balances deliverability and simplicity?
2. What technical approach (CLI vs web UI) offers the most straightforward path to completion?
3. What specific features should be included in the MVP while maintaining simplicity?
   1. e.g. text processing is fine, but are agentic actions - e.g. running commands, something that can be achieved? Can an SLM process an image for instance?
4. Which SLM capabilities provide the most value with the least complexity?

## Success Definition

Joe will feel successful when he has:

1. A working application that provides genuine utility
2. Complete understanding of how each module works
3. A GitHub repository showing the full development process
4. Confidence that he can build more complex SLM applications in the future

## Next Steps

Use this brief to guide application idea selection and technical architecture decisions in the next analysis session.
