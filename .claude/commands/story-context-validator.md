Validate and update existing story context XML files for completeness and structure integrity.

This command runs the custom BMAD story-context-validator agent to:

- Analyze story context XML files for missing sections and incompleteness
- Check XML structure validity and BMAD story compliance
- Present numbered findings before making any changes
- Get user approval before updating existing files
- Ensure comprehensive documentation structure

Usage: Run to validate and improve existing .context.xml files.

The agent will systematically analyze the target file and guide you through any necessary updates with full user approval.
